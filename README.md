# Power-BI-ED
Project


Start by understanding the business requirements and the key objectives for the Power BI project. This ensures the final report aligns with the goals and provides valuable insights.

Gather Data: Collect data from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, and cloud services. This step involves ensuring that all necessary data is available for analysis.

Clean Data: Clean the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to prepare it for analysis.

Model Data: Design a data model that supports the required analysis. This involves defining relationships between tables, creating calculated columns, and optimizing the model for performance.

Build Visuals: Create interactive visuals such as charts, graphs, and tables. These visuals are designed to communicate insights clearly and help users make informed decisions.

By following these steps, I ensure the Power BI project not only meets business needs but also provides actionable insights in a user-friendly format. This approach results in high-quality, reliable reports that facilitate data-driven decision-making.
